Recipes Project from TOP foundations course

This project represents my initial first steps of understanding & embracing the neccesities for HTML, CSS & it's structure. Overtime, this repository will be maintained (updated) to represent what I have learned through TOP lessons. Inside, contains a small recipe site that includes an image of the food, description, instructions, and nutritional facts for each.

(12/16/2021) Edit: adding CSS as practice for CSS-Foundations lesson. I'm only adding CSS to index.html at the moment, so it's easier to declutter & remodel this repo later.

(12/17/2021) Edit: updated style.css & index.html - I didn't feel confident with my understanding of CSS after the lessons, I wanted to put more time practicing.
